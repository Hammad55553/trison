# 🔐 Authentication Testing Guide

## 🎯 Current Status
- ✅ React Native app is running on Android emulator
- ✅ Login screen updated with OTP functionality
- ✅ Redux authentication state management ready
- ✅ FastAPI backend configured (needs to be started)

## 📱 Testing the Authentication

### 1. App is Running! 🎉
Your React Native app should now be visible on the Android emulator with:
- **Splash Screen** → **Login Screen**
- **Authentication Status** component showing current state

### 2. Test Login Flow
1. **Enter Phone Number**: Use any 11-digit number (e.g., 03001234567)
2. **Click "Send OTP"**: This will call your FastAPI backend
3. **Enter OTP**: Check console logs for the OTP (currently logged, not SMS)
4. **Click "Verify OTP & Login"**: Complete authentication

### 3. What You'll See
- **Authentication Status** component shows real-time state
- **Success/Error alerts** for each step
- **Loading states** during API calls
- **Automatic navigation** after successful login

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Start FastAPI Backend
```bash
# In a new terminal
cd /Users/mac/React-native/trison
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

### Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test if backend is working
python test_api.py
```

## 🔍 Debug Information

The **AuthStatus** component shows:
- ✅ Is Authenticated
- ⏳ Loading State
- 🔑 Access Token Status
- 👤 User Role
- ❌ Any Errors

## 🌐 API Connection

Your app connects to:
- **ngrok URL**: `https://78a5583fa550.ngrok-free.app`
- **API Base**: `/api/v1`
- **Auth Endpoints**: `/auth/send-otp`, `/auth/verify-otp`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

- ✅ OTP sent successfully
- ✅ OTP verified and tokens received
- ✅ User authenticated in Redux
- ✅ Navigation to main app
- ✅ JWT tokens stored locally

## 🚨 Common Issues

1. **"Failed to send OTP"**: FastAPI backend not running
2. **"Invalid OTP"**: Check console logs for actual OTP
3. **Network errors**: Verify ngrok is running and accessible

## 📱 Current App Features

- **Phone Number Input** with validation
- **OTP Input** with 6-digit limit
- **Resend OTP** with 60-second countdown
- **Change Phone Number** option
- **Real-time Authentication Status**
- **Error Handling** with user-friendly alerts

Your authentication system is now fully integrated and ready to test! 🚀
